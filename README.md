### Run By Yourself

### Hosted Solutions
* [Binder](https://mybinder.org) - Allows execution of notebooks from GitHub etc. (takes some time to rebuild after commits to the notebook)
* [Deepnote](https://www.deepnote.com) - Allows execution and real-time collaboration of notebooks (requires account for now)
* [Colaboratory](https://colab.research.google.com) - Allows execution of notebooks (fast, but requires sign-in for execution)
* [nbviewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org) - Renders notebooks from any public URL (faster than via GitHub preview)
